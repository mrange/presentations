Reference: 24.2 sec, iterations: 6248109921, flops: 56,232,989,289 => 2.3 GigaFlop/s
Referencex4: 3.7 sec => 6.5x => 15 GigaFlops/s

AVX: 0.49 sec => 49x => 114 GigaFlops/s
AVX4: 0.39 sec => 62x => 143 GigaFlops/s

Reference DNC: 24.6 sec

AVX4_DNC: 0.76 sec => 32x => 73 GigaFlops/s
But this uses SSE which is by nature twice as slow AVX
